                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4gpu developers and taggers to briefly 
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep 
track of all directory-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  SVN log-message one should put at every
committal in the SVN repository !

August 23, 2012 Dhruva T.B.
---------------------------------------------------------
Fix for NewNavigation in gpu.c. The while( cur_vol) loop now exits only when all threads are ready. The way this is done is by using local bools and using
the NoStepReduction to find whether all threads are ready to exit. if(voxelised) ?.
Minor changes to naming convention and code cleanup. Find_minimum is now implemented seperately in an external icc file.



August 17 , 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Fix for NewNavigation. SamplePoint used to calculate the step and safety in the previous version was wrong.
A new array called LocationArray has been implemented which stores the information of the localPoint and its direction which are used
when calculating the steps. Minor changes also made in naming convention. A new int locationId is now used for array indexing whose value is 
set depending on whether GLOBAL_MODE  is set or not. 


August 15 , 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Fix for New Navigation implemented. Fix adds a new bool noStepAll to ensure that the while(noStep) loop is exited by all threads in sync and that all threads see barriers correctly.
New Navigation does not loop indefinitely any longer. toy1 works correctly.
Open Issues with toy2-: 
With GLOBAL_MODE  set to zero compiler crashes. With GLOBAL_MODE  set to 1 code gives zero output. 

August 12 , 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Updates for OpenCL AMD. Defined GLOBAL_MODE  macro and testing code with global memory in place of shared memory. Changes to openclmain and G4NewNavigation.c
Code no longer hangs on barrier statement. Changes made only for debugging purposes. Final revision should set GLOBAL_MODE  to 0 in gpuconf.h
Current open issue with Prefix_Sum calculation.

August 08 , 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Updating with changes to OpenCL AMD version of the code. Changes made to VoxelNavigation.c ( legacy ) and gpu.c which now allows toy1 and toy2 tests to run
with VoxelNavigation. With NewNavigation enabled toy1 runs but toy2 does not run.
Commit from lxplus made but changes not reflected in log file. New macro SHAREDSHADOW defined to allow for consistency with CUDA. Since CUDA code does not allow
type specifiers shared memory arrays should now be defined with SHAREDTYPE but when their pointers are being passed to functions use SHAREDSHADOW. This is so that
when being passed into functions the shadow does not define any type specifier.
Minor changes made to try and print from Cuda kernels. Changes not tested yet.

August 02 , 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Defined new macro GEOMTYPE.
Error on OpenCL AMD version was found ( by using the Geometry Check ) to be with inconsistency of size of unsigned long on CPU and GPU.
New macro called GEOMTYPE defined and replaced in appropriate places. Code tested to work ( toy1 and VoxelNavigation with toy2) with this 
macro on all platforms. 


July 24, 2012 Dhruva T.B. 
---------------------------------------------------------
Made changes so that the code with VoxelNavigation works with CUDA. 
Fix for the bug which was causing so many problems was in everything.h. Changed the definition of INLINEFUNC from static inline to just inline.
Other minor changes ( barrier statements replaced with __syncthreads() ) made for CUDA compatibility. 
New Navigation still not tested on the CUDA machine.


July 23, 2012 Dhruva T.B.				(To be called g4gpu-V00-01-04)
----------------------------------------------------------
Made first tagged version in /tags/first-tag. This version has some fixes in cuda.cpp to get the code
to compile for CUDA and some changes to allow it to compile for openCL on 64bit.
However these changes are not complete and the code in this revision does NOT work. It is only a test revision to
update tags. The tag was created on the lxplus machine and not using Tortoise SVN.


July 20, 2012 Dhruva T.B.				(To be called g4gpu-V00-01-04)
----------------------------------------------------------
Find_minimum function implemented to find the minimum step. Find_minimum tested using kernel test and confirmed to work.
The Find_minimum calculates the minimum step among all the step sizes in a shared memory array and stores the result 
along with the safety and a pointer to the Physical Volume in another array passed in as the second argument. 
NOTE that the function is implemented in G4Navigator.h. ( This is one place I could think of where all the structs etc. that need to be defined 
before can be defined and so that it can be accessed by NewNavigation and gpu.c)

New Navigation not completely implemented and tested yet. 


July 17, 2012 Dhruva T.B.				(To be called g4gpu-V00-01-03
----------------------------------------------------------
Added new navigation as a seperate class. Now voxel navigation and new navigation can be run by specifying
the macro ENABLE_NEW_NAVIGATION in gpuconf.h The new code compiles and executes ( it does not loop indefinitely ).
The implementation to find the minimum is in G4Navigator.h . 
The current implemenation is only the most basic one. Future version will change the way the voxels return volumes
such that the volumes are returned sorted by type.

However, the new code has not been tested for compatibility with CUDA.

NOTE: In this version of the code, results for OpenCL and CUDA do NOT match. There is still some inconsistency
which needs to be looked into. On running toy1 geometry quite a few values seem similar, but toy2 is completely inconsistent.
The inconsistency is between results on OpenCL and those on CUDA. On their own, the results for each do not change, it is only
when compared against each other that the results do not match.
